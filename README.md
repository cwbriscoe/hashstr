# hashstr

# Before I wrote this library, I did not know about the `encoding/hex` package.  As you can see by the last benchmark, it is the fastest option and does not require a separate library.  I would recommend using that. 

A faster conversion of []byte to hex string for cryptographic sum functions in golang.

It is over 3x faster than using `Sprintf` on my machine.

### Example:

```
content := []byte("This is some file content")
sum := sha1.Sum(content)
str := hashstr.Sha1ToLowerString(sum)
fmt.Println(str)
```
